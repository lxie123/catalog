  Gcore Edge AI solutions combine the power of artificial intelligence with edge computing.
  This allows you to run high-performance computing tasks and deep learning closer to end-user
  devices, which significantly improves response times and overall efficiency.

  When deployed via k0rdent, GCore can be used to serve AI workloads across multiple Kubernetes
  clusters, supporting scenarios such as geo-distributed inference, load-spreading across regions,
  and failover of inference endpoints.

  k0rdent Enterprise Required.
